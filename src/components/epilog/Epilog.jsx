              EpiLog is a mHealth mobile app with the purpose of helping people with epilepsy 
              track their seizures and other epilepsy-related symptoms.

          <p>
            Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that often results in seizures and other 
            long-lasting symptoms. Common treatments for epilepsy include medication, diets, 
            and surgery. All people with epilepsy must be constantly alert for anything that 
            could be a symptom or trigger of an oncoming seizure. Recognizing patterns in 
            triggers can benefit treatment - an effective way to do this is by using an app 
            to track the condition.

            From analyzing what exists currently on the market, there is an opportunity to create
            a platform that expands upon existing features in a modern and intuitive interface, 
            inherently setting it apart from other competitors.
          </p>
          <h2>Ideation/Validation</h2>
          <p>
            After discussing with our stakeholder, we decided the following were the most important 
            features to design for:
          </p>
          <p>1. Seizure/symptom tracking</p>
          <p>2. Live record for seizures</p>
          <p>3. Notification reminders</p>
          <p>4. Personal in-app profile</p>
          <h3>Sketches</h3>
          <p>Below are some initial sketches I did during the feature ideation session with the team.</p>
          <h2>Prototyping</h2>
          <h3>Low fidelity</h3>
          <p>
            After splitting up the proposed features with my design partner, we began designing 
            individually. Below are some of the low fidelity pages that I designed.
          </p>
          <h3>Mid fidelity</h3>
          <p>
            My design partner and I came back together to combine our designs. Through this process, 
            we discussed how to make the interface intuitive to users. We decided that we would use 
            card-style sections and common iconography as familiar elements from other apps to reduce 
            the overall learning curve a new user would have with the app.
          </p>
          <h3>Branding</h3>
          <p>
            After combining our designs, we worked with our stakeholder to determine an appropriate color 
            scheme for the app. As epilepsy is represented by Purple Day and by extension, the color purple, 
            we decided to make that the main color of app. We chose to use muted primary and lighter colors 
            to highlight different sections in a non-intrusive manner.
          </p>
          <h3>High fidelity</h3>
          <p>
            Below are a few pages from our high-fidelity prototype that we applied our branding color scheme to.
          </p>
          <h2>User Testing</h2>
          <p>
            After finalizing our high fidelity designs, we proceeded with user testing. We reached out to multiple 
            people with epilepsy and their families to test a prototype of our app. Feedback was positive with a 
            few suggestions for improvements for the features.
